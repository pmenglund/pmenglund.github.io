I've been blogging since I worked at [Sun Microsystems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) and we setup [blog.sun.com](https://blogs.oracle.com/martin/), and after abandoning the sinking ship when the Oracle behemoth [swallowed it](http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/index.html), I've kept my blog going in a couple of places as [blog.codenursery.com](http://blog.codenursery.com/). The time has come to move it yet another time, and hopefully for the last in a couple of years.

The new location will be [blog.englund.nu](https://blog.englund.nu) and will reside in my [github account](https://github.com/pmenglund), which makes perfect sense to me. I *really* don't like the web UI interfaces I've been using, so using github pages will probably make me happy. Not only will I keep the files as plain text it will also be checked in to git!

I plan to slowly and steadily transfer the content over here, and hopefully add some new content too.
