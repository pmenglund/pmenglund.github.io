After upgrading to El Capitan I ran into a weird issue trying to update the `github-pages` Ruby gem. It failed saying it could not find [libgmp](https://gmplib.org), but I knew it was installed and updating it to the latest version didn't help either.

Here's the output from bundler:

Looking in the `mkmf.log` I saw:

    ld: library not found for -lgmp

which didn't make sense, but then I remembered that I had seen a similar issue when I upgraded to Yosemite, so I ran this to install XCode commandline tools:

    xcode-select --install

which solved the problem!
