An often used tool on UNIX is `ldd`, but that doesn't exist on Mac - however I just found out that there is `otool` which can do the same thing:

    martin@vaccine$ otool -L /usr/bin/curl
    /usr/bin/curl:
        /usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 8.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.5)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1213.0.0)
